"""V4.1 sparse attention with FP8 SWA fake quantization.

A copy of ``torchtitan_npu.override.deepseek_v4_1.sparse_attn.ascendc`` with the
quantization inserted: the sliding-window KV is fake-quantized to FP8 (MXFP8,
group 32) on the way into the kernel, and the same quantized tensor is replayed in
the backward so both passes see identical operands.  Its gradient passes straight
through to the original input, i.e. the Q/DQ is an identity STE.

The main KV is *not* quantized here.  It arrives already fake-quantized: the
source Compressor does the Q/DQ once, on the layer that produces it, and every
consuming layer reuses that tensor (``QuantCompressor``).  Quantizing on
consumption instead would repeat the work on all 40 layers rather than the four
that own a compressor, and would quantize a second time on top of it.

Everything else -- the TND layout, the metadata frames, the document-local
selection and the kernel options -- is the port's behaviour, deliberately kept
line-for-line so the quantized stack and the unquantized one cannot drift.
