"""The context-parallel query plan of one packed row, and the exchange that runs it.

Shape legend: ``R = cp_size``; ``r = rank``; ``N`` the row's tokens, ``C = N // R`` the slab
width; ``L_d`` document ``d``'s length and ``Q_d = L_d // R`` its chunk.

Rank ``r`` holds the plain slab ``[r·C, (r+1)·C)`` of the row, and the queries move onto
**chunk ``r`` of every document**: one chunk of every document is what makes the per-document
reach ``K_d = (r+1)·Q_d`` the same kind of problem on every rank.

The KV side is **not** moved.  It is gathered declaratively at the kernel boundary (``cp: S(1)
-> R`` on the fused core's inputs) and ``seqused = K_d`` is what limits a rank's view, which is
also what keeps the kernels' end-aligned reading -- the sliding window and the compressed
causal limit are anchored at this rank's reach instead of at the row's end -- so the KV streams
stay the whole row on every rank.

``cp_plan`` derives the movement from the global document boundaries alone: pure, on host
values, zero communication.  ``QueryExchange`` is the module that runs it, owning the process
group that ``parallelize`` wires, and :class:`ExchangeMetadata` is one batch's tables, carried
on the attention metadata so no consumer needs a new argument.
