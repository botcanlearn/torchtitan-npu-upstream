#   * tests/smoke_tests/ops/test_mhc_triton.py (26 cases): triton-ascend
#     hardcodes -std=c++17 when it builds its NPU host stub / precompiled
#     header, while torch >= 2.14 refuses anything below C++20
#     (ATen/ATen.h:5), so every Triton kernel launch fails to compile.
#   * the SDC three-strikes checksum case: torch_npu renamed the ASD checksum
#     dtype flag (matmul_with_bf16 -> matmul_dtype_supported), so the checksum
#     is never linked and `checksum_enable` never flips.
