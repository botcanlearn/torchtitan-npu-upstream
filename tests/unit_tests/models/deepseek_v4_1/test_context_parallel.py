"""The V4.1 context-parallel query plan: the movement, the frames, and their invariants.

The layout is one packed row's coordinate change, so every property worth pinning is
checkable without a device and without a process group: which rows a rank ends up holding,
that the movement is a permutation of the slab, that the receive side's closed form agrees
with the row-by-row derivation, that the frames say the queries are the chunks while the KV
streams stay the row, and that the metadata pairs the reference half with the unsharded
forward only.

The collectives are emulated in process, from the plan's own tables -- the same tables the
forward hands to ``all_to_all_single`` -- because a plan is what this file is about; the
module's own call into the collective is a thin wrapper over them.
